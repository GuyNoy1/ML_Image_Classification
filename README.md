# Assignment 3: Image Classification

As a part of Introduction To Machine Learning course we recieved the following task:

In this assignment, we will build a convolutional neural network that can predict whether two shoes are from the same pair or from two different pairs. This kind of application can have real-world applications: for example to help people who are visually impaired to have more independence.

We will explore two convolutional architectures. While we will give you starter code to help make data processing a bit easier, in this assignment you have a chance to build your neural network mostly by yourself.
